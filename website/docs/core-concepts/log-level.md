**Logry** supports **seven log levels**, ordered from most critical to most verbose:

| Level    |     | Description                                                                        |
| -------- | --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fatal`  | ‚ùó  | Logs critical system failures. The application may crash or exit immediately       |
| `error`  | ‚ùå  | Logs runtime errors that should be investigated and typically require action       |
| `warn`   | ‚ö†Ô∏è  | Logs recoverable issues or unexpected behaviors that don't prevent operation       |
| `info`   | ‚ÑπÔ∏è  | Logs general operational messages, such as successful startups or actions          |
| `debug`  | üõ†Ô∏è  | Logs detailed internal information helpful for debugging                           |
| `trace`  | üîç  | Logs the most granular details, every step, useful for profiling or deep debugging |
| `silent` | ü§ê  | Disables all logging output                                                        |

The logger only outputs messages **at or above the current level**.  
For example, if the level is set to `warn`, only `warn`, `error`, and `fatal` logs will be printed.

> Core-level configs like **level** are only applied when creating a new core.  
> If a core with the same ID exists, those configs will be ignored, and a warning will be logged.

```ts
// Initialize a logger with a preferred level
const logger = logry({ id: "my-app", level: "debug" });
```

Normally, the logger will only output messages at or above the configured level.  
However, you can force a log to be emitted regardless of the current level:

```ts
logger.force.error("Something went wrong!");
logger.force.info("This will show even if level is set to 'warn'");
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Use this with care‚Äî`force` is designed for exceptional situations where logs must be guaranteed to appear.

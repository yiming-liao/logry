**Logry** is designed with a focus on **console output** as the primary logging target.  
The Platform Transporter is tailored for each environment to efficiently handle core console output.

Beyond console output, tasks like _file writing_, _remote logging_, or _service integration_ are handled by flexible, user-defined **Handlers**.  
This plugin-like architecture allows you to easily extend or customize logging behavior without affecting the main console pipeline.

>  while Handlers are the creative backstage crew adding all the magic._

This architecture ensures that:

- The console remains the central output, optimized for each platformâ€™s specifics.
- Other output destinations can be easily added or modified by introducing new Handlers.
- The system maintains consistency and reliability, while providing maximum flexibility to adapt to various use cases and environments.
